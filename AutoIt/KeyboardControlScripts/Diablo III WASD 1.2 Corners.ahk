													WASD TEST SCRIPT
									Authors: Ever1ast, Jared Sigley aka Yelgis, Soda
											Based on code by Desi Quintans

Description:

This script enables traditional WASD movements for Diablo III. 

The default keys are:
North - W
West - A
South - S
East - D

The keys can be combined to produce a total of 8 directions (4 ordinal and 4 diagonal). The directions are relative to the 
screen, meaning north is moving towards the top of the screen, west is moving towards the left of the screen, and so on.



Use Instructions:
1) Run this script with AutoHotKey
2) Start Diablo III within 60 seconds of step 1
3) If this is your first time running this script remove bindings for the "W" "A" "S" and "D" keys in Diablo III. If any 
	action is bound to one of the keys used for movement by this script the action would be performed in addition to the 
	movement. Keep in mind if you edit this script to use another keyset the same rule applies to those keys
4) Bind the F12 key on your keyboard to the Move action.

NOTE:
If you change the resolution of the game at any point after running the script, you must reload the script for it to function properly
