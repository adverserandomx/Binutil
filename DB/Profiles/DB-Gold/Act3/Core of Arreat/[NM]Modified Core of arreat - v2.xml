    Version 0.1 - Published 6/12/2012 by Farix
	Known issues:
	6/12/2012 - Leaves game the slow way on first runs, as of right now this is the work-around to UseTownPortal -> LeaveGame malfunction.
	6/12/2012 - Goes to anti-stuck checkpoints then pauses for a second or three. I believe this to be a glitch with the bot coding and searching for objects to loot. Work-around is to deal with it.
	Fixed:
	6/12/2012 - Doesn't crash after initial completion of run, starting from in-town.
    6/12/2012 - Leaves properly on run starting from inside the Core of Arreat level 3
    6/12/2012 - No longer gets stuck in the lava. Either direction.
	
	Version 1 - Updated 6/12/2012 by Farix
	
	Added:
	6/12/2012 - Added an extra waypoint into the "saved" run line, hopefully it should resolve a final stuck problem.
	
	Version 1.2 - Updated 6/12/2012 by Farix
	
	Added:
	6/12/2012 - Added an extra anti-stuck waypoint into the "saved" run line, hopefully it should resolve a stuck problem.
	
	Version 1.3 - Updated 6/13/2012 by Farix
	*Streamlined the saved path waypoints. Should increase GHP as well as prevent stucks.
